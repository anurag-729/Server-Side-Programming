            <p style="text-align: justify;">The city was first named Indreshwar which was named after the 
                Indreshwar Temple in the city. Indreshwara temple- the oldest shrine at Indore, believed to 
                have been named on its original patron- the Rashtrakuta king Indra III of the 10th Century. 
                The Shiva temple was restored by Subedar Malhar Rao in 1741, in whose time Indore was an 
                existing trading post and a camping site for guerrilla activities. Malhar Rao tried to 
                rubberstamp the city as Malharnagari but the old name was not to call quits. It was this 
                temple that gave Indore her name, and the Juni Indur came around.
                <br>
                Indore is old settlement which started at the end of 15th century. Its original nucleus was a 
                riverside village, which occupied the bank of river Sarasvati. This area is now known as Juni 
                Indore. The little village grew as an important halting place for pilgrims traveling between 
                great religious cities, Ujjain on the bank of the Holy River Kshipra; Omkerashwar on the banks 
                of River Narmada. Later, in addition to the halting place it also became a camping place for 
                forces of Moghulâ€™s and Marathas who frequently moved to South and North for expanding their 
                kingdoms. The Zamindars of village Kampel (about 10 km. S.E) visualized the opportunity of 
                flourishing trade in this settlement and settled on the banks of the River Kanha. To withstand 
                the foreign invasions, Zamindars built a castle, giving this village a character of a walled 
                town, although the town hardly suffered the destruction of feudal wars. There was increase in 
                trade and commerce with zamindars investing in the city and thus the city expanded as a trade 
                centre.
