                historic church located in the cantonment area of Indore. Built in the late 19th century, 
                this colonial-era church is renowned for its pristine white facade and neo-gothic architecture. 
                The church's interior features stained glass windows, wooden pews, and ornate altars, creating 
                a serene and tranquil ambiance for worshippers. St. Anne's Church serves as a place of worship 
                for the Christian community in Indore and also attracts visitors with its architectural beauty 
                and historical significance.</p>
